# bitPublish

Quarto extension for a template to publish a PDF book with LaTeX styling.

## Installing the extension for a new document or project

To install the Quarto extension, create a directory, and use the template file:

```
quarto use template bit2r/bitPublish
```

## Installation for an existing document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document to download the _extensions folder:

```
quarto install extension bit2r/bitPublish
```

## But not yet

It's not implemented yet, so it won't install.
